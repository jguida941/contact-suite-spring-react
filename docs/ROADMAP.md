# Roadmap

> For full details, checklist, and code examples, see **[REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md)**.

## Implementation Order

```
Phase 0   ✅ Pre-API fixes (defensive copies, date validation)
Phase 1   ✅ Spring Boot scaffold (layered packages, actuator, smoke tests)
Phase 2   ✅ REST API + DTOs + OpenAPI (344 tests, PIT mutation 100% / 99% line coverage on mutated classes)
Phase 2.5 ✅ API fuzzing in CI (Schemathesis 30,668 tests, ZAP-ready artifacts)
Phase 3   ✅ Persistence (Spring Data JPA, Flyway, Postgres, Testcontainers)
Phase 4   ✅ React UI (Vite + React 19 + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui, full CRUD, Maven-integrated)
Phase 5   → Security + Observability
Phase 5.5 → DAST + auth tests
Phase 6   → Docker packaging + CI
Phase 7   → UX polish
```

Phase 4 note: Full CRUD UI with React Hook Form + Zod validation. `mvn package` builds UI via frontend-maven-plugin and packages into single JAR. Run with `java -jar target/*.jar`. See ADR-0025..0028 for design decisions.

Phase 3 note: legacy `getInstance()` access now reuses the Spring-managed proxies (or the in-memory fallback pre-boot) without proxy unwrapping; behavior tests verify both entry points stay in sync.

## CI/CD Security Stages

```
Phase 8  → ZAP in CI
Phase 9  → API fuzzing in CI
Phase 10 → Auth/role tests in CI
```
