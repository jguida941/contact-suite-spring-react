# Design Notes

This folder holds my personal explanations of design decisions
(singletons, validation helpers, ConcurrentHashMap, CI layout, etc.)
in plain language. These notes back up the formal ADRs and
architecture docs but are not part of the graded deliverables.

The root README stays here for quick context; the actual note pages
live under [`notes/`](notes/) so this directory remains tidy.
